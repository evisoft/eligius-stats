eligius-stats
=============

These scripts generate statistics (xHTML pages and graphes) about the Eligius pool available at http://eligius.st/~artefact2/.

It requires PHP >= 5.3 with the curl extension, and Apache2 (other HTTPd may work too, if you rewrite the .htaccess yourself).

These scripts are distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.
